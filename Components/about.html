                <p>In our final year at MCKV Institute of Technology, we undertook a significant project focusing on the development of three 
                    machine learning modules: one for detecting spam emails, another for identifying phishing websites, 
                    and a third for detecting banking fraud. As the culmination of our efforts, we constructed a comprehensive 
                    website that integrates all three modules into a single platform. This website serves as a centralized hub, 
                    providing users with access to these essential detection mechanisms, effectively consolidating our project's 
                    objectives under one roof.
